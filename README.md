# Fate-of-Olympus
2D platformer using Unity. In Fate of Olympus, the gods
have been locked away by Hades. With their last remaining
bit of influence on the earth, they create a series of
trials that award powers and items to the ones that 
complete them in order to find a champion that can
defeat Hades and free the gods from their imprisonment.
